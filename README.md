## Insights
It is a great project to practise with strings, join method and user inputs.
One of the challenges I faced at the beginnig was the join method, since it was the first time I worked directly with this method I had to reach out documentation in order to grasp the fundamentals.
It is way interesting how this method works and how many lines of code we can save just with this great tool.
